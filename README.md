EPray

EPray is an "e-health" web application that prays for people's health all around the world so that users do not need to use an actually e-health application.
The app contains prayers for multiple religions(Christian, Muslim, Rastafari and Budism). Users can listen to prayers targeted on their specific health issue and also they can pray for someone else by simply introducing an email address. Users can also register and log in.
The app is inspired by Romanian people's beliefs about religion.
